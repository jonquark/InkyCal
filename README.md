# Overview

Not much to see here at the moment. This currently a butchered version of the Google
Calendar Example from Inkplate.

IMPORTANT: Before running the sketch - copy secrets.h.example to secrets.h and
set wifi password etc in the secrets.h version.

I plan to make it show selected events from multiple calendars etc... but that isn't implemented yet
