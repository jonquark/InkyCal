# Overview

A Google Calendar Implementation for the InkPlate 6Color eInk display.

IMPORTANT: Before running the sketch - copy secrets.h.example to secrets.h and
set wifi password etc in the secrets.h version.

It was originally based on the example calendar sketch for the InkPlate 6 Color
but has been largely rewritten (aside from the display code). It has:

* Support for multiple calendars
* Support for calendars larger than RAM
* Support for all day events and (some) support for recurring events
* Support for filtering events
